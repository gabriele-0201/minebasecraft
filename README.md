# Minebasecraft

This is an attempt to create a base minecraft from scratch, using c++ and openGL.

The starting idea was simply to learn OpenGL but after watched the video of jdh (making minecraft in 48 hours) I wanted to do it myself.

This is a couple week project so there is only some feature:
+ [x] Terrain Generation
    + [x] Using Multithreading
+ [x] Fly camera
+ [x] Remove and Add blocks (you can add only sand for now)
